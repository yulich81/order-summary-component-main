### What I learned

I've learned how to add multiple background items: color+img.

This code I used:

```
{
background: url(./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg) hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to learn more about background, gradients, etc.
My priority is to follow mobile first concept.
